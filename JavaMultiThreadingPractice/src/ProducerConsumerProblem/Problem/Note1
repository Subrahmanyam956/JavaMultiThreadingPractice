This is a simple producer consumer problem.
Here the producer and the consumer are in a deadlock state.

We heve two locks and
producer acquired a lock(LockA) and waiting for another lock(LockB)
Consumer acquired a lock(LockB) and waiting for another lock(LockA).



Here we also implemented the brokerbuffer implementation
where producer and the consumer are in sync with each other using wait and notify and
there is no deadlock between them.
