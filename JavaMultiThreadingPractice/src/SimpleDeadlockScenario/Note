This is a simple example to show how deadlock happens.

Here in this example we have created two threads, t1 and t2.

We have two objects and we would explain deadlocks using synchronized lock on two different objects
(/ resources) lockObjectA and lockObjectB.

Now thread t1 -> starts execution, then get synchronized over lockObjectA. And sleeps for 500ms.

Now thread t2 -> starts execution, then get synchronized over lockObjectB. And sleeps for 500ms.

Now t1 aftwe waking up tries to use lockObjectB and waits to get from thread t2 but t2 is currently using it
and still not letting it go.
