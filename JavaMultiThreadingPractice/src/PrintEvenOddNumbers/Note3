Question:

        Take Two threads and an input value n. Now from 1 to n...print all the even number by
one thread and all the odd numbers by another thread.


Answer :
    To answer this question we are using the concepts of wait() and notify() methods
    along with synchronized keyword.

    we are using the wait() and notify() depending on the current value of the curVal.

    Now we are also using synchronized keyword at method level because at any point of time in the code,
    we only want one thread to be available running the method of the code. we do not want
    other thread to be in the same section of the code at a time.

    If we use synchronized there will always be only one thread at the section of the code and we
    can make them run one after the other based on the wait() and notify() methods usage.
